# Deep Learning Pipelines for Apache Spark on Databricks

This repository demonstrates how to use Deep Learning Pipelines (DLP) with Apache Spark on Databricks, providing a scalable solution for deep learning applications.

## Project Overview

Deep Learning Pipelines is a Databricks library that integrates popular deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras) with Apache Spark's MLlib Pipelines and Spark SQL. This project showcases how to build and use deep learning pipelines for large-scale image processing, leveraging Spark's distributed computing capabilities.

## Objectives

- Develop a robust pipeline for applying deep learning models to large-scale image datasets.
- Implement transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained models for specific tasks.
- Evaluate scalability and performance using Apache Spark.

## Key Features

- **Image Data Handling:** Process and transform images using Spark DataFrames.
- **Transfer Learning:** Adapt pre-trained models for new tasks with minimal effort.
- **Model Application at Scale:** Apply deep learning models to large datasets using Spark MLlib Transformers.
- **Custom Models Support:** Apply custom TensorFlow and Keras models.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. **Create Databricks Account:**
   - Sign up for a Databricks account and create a new workspace.

2. **Install Libraries:**
   - Add the `spark-deep-learning` library to your cluster via Maven Coordinate.
   - Install required Python libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, h5py, and `spark-deep-learning`.

### Image Data Handling

1. **Obtain Dataset:**
   - Download and extract the image dataset.

2. **Load Images:**
   - Use DLP tools to read images into Spark DataFrames.

### Transfer Learning

1. **Prepare Data:**
   - Create training and test data frames.

2. **Train Model:**
   - Train and evaluate models using transfer learning.

### Model Application

1. **Apply Models:**
   - Use Spark MLlib Transformers to apply deep learning models to large datasets.
   - Apply pre-trained models or custom TensorFlow/Keras models.

## Testing

- Apply pre-trained Keras models (e.g., InceptionV3) to images and evaluate predictions.
- Ensure efficient handling of large datasets using Spark DataFrames.

## Future Enhancements

- **Distributed Hyper-Parameter Tuning:** Automate hyper-parameter tuning with Spark MLlib Pipelines.
- **SQL Functions for Deep Learning:** Develop SQL functions for applying models directly in queries.
- **Enhanced Image Processing:** Improve tools for image data processing and support additional pre-trained models.
